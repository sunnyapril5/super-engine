<p>Once you dipped into Jellyfish Lake, it is Surreal:
<p style="text-align:center">You can Touch the stingless jellyfish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">You can Swim with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">You can Look at them as they swim by you.</p>
<p style="color:red">In this lake, the jellyfish have adapted to the new conditions by losing their sting.</p>
<p style="color:blue">The Stingless Jellyfish gets suntan or sunbathe in the afternoon.</p>
<p style="color:purple">At night the jellyfish swim to the bottom of the lake and get fed</p>
