<h1>ViViaN</h1>
<h2> Virtual Visiting Nurse! </h2>
<h3> A virtual voice interactive personal care assistant at home - think Amazon Alexa</h3>

<p>ViViaN creates a trusted relationship over time with the elderly patient who is a newly diagnosed diabetic.</p>
<br><i>She speaks and relates to the patient&#39;s needs and concerns.</i>
<br><i>She creates a closed loop system between the patient, clinical care team, and family.</i>  
<br><i>She focuses on the four pillars of diabetic care management - medication adherence, insulin compliance, proper diet, and exercise through positive reinforcement, health education, and reminders.</i>

<p>Initially, we are focusing on newly diagnosed elderly diabetic patients transitioning from acute care to home setting. This population may have issues in maintaining clinical treatment regiments.  This population tends to have memory and cognitive functioning issues.</p>
